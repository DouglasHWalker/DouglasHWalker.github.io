    <h2>About DH Walker</h2>
    <p>Technology, science, and reason have lifted the world into the most productive period of human existence. Charles Babbage invented the first mechanical computer in 1820. Over 90% of the world lived in poverty during his life, and less than 14% could read or write. Today, we have lifted 80% of the world out of extreme poverty, worldwide literacy is 94%, and life expectancy has increased by 40 years.</p>
    <p style="font-style: italic;">“There can be no question of which was the greatest period for culture; the answer has to be today until it is superseded by tomorrow”. Steven Pinker.</p> 
    <p>The past reveals how far we have come. However, progress uncovers additional complexities. The critical issues of our time require diligence and global collaboration to solve. Technology, science, and reason will underpin our solutions. Software engineers dedicate themselves to solving complex problems. I am excited to be a part of positive cultural progress. </p>
