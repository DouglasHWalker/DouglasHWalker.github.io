    <h2>My Motivations</h2>
    <img />
    <p>Charles Babbage invented the first mechanical computer in 1820. A year in which 90% of the world lived in absolute poverty, and less than 15% could read or write. Today, a non-negligible 10% live in poverty, worldwide literacy is 94%, and life expectancy has increased by 40 years. Technology, science, and reason have lifted the world into the most productive period of human existence.</p>
    <p style="font-style: italic;">“There can be no question of which was the greatest period for culture; <br/> the answer has to be today until it is superseded by tomorrow”. <br/>Steven Pinker.</p> 
    <p>Progress uncovers inevitable complexity. The problems we now face require novel tools and global collaboration to resolve. Technology, science, and reason will underpin our answers. Software engineers dedicate themselves to solving complex problems and I am motivated to be a positive part of technological transformation.</p>
    <p>Here are some of the technolgies I use to build useful tools.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>C++, Java, Python, Swift, Kotlin</li>
        <li>React, Angular, Typescript</li>
        <li>SQL, MongoDB, NoSQL</li>
        <li>HTML, CSS, JavaScript (ES6+)</li>
        <li>Development stacks: MEAN, MERN</li>
    </ul>
