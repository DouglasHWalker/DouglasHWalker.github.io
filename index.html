    <h2>Motivation</h2>
    <p>Technology, science, and reason have lifted the world into the greatest period of human existence. When Charles Babbage invented the first mechanical computer, 90% of the world lived in absolute poverty, and less than 15% could read or write. Since then, 80% of the world has been lifted out of poverty, literacy has incrased to 94%, and life expectancy has increased by 40 years.</p>
    <p style="text-align: right; color: #ddd;">“There can be no question of which was the greatest period for culture; <br/> the answer has to be today until it is superseded by tomorrow”.</span> <br/> Steven Pinker.</p> 
    <p>Progress uncovers inevitable complexity. The challenges we face require novel tools and global collaboration to resolve. Technology, science, and reason will underpin our answers. <span style="color: #7DB5FD;">Software engineers dedicate themselves to solving complex problems and I am motivated to be a positive part of technological transformation.</span></p>
